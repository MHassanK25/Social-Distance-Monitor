# Social-Distance-Monitor
Distance Measurer using Serial Monitor and LEDs

Description
In my project I wanted to create something that was related and could perhaps even be used during this pandemic we are currently facing. 
My distance measurer could be used in social distancing for people at social events, workplaces and even in recreational areas such as parks etc. 
My distance measurer uses an ultrasonic sensor to gauge the distance of an object/person. It displays that distance in centimetres in the serial monitor. 
Also, from a distance of 49 centimetres away (Can easily be adjusted to fit the recommended distance of 1 metre during this pandemic.) the first LED switches on, which can be an indicator that one is getting too close or just a reminder of the distance of the object.
At a distance of 42 centimetres the second LED comes on, then the third at 35 centimetres, the fourth at 28 centimetres, the fifth at 21 centimetres, the sixth at 14 centimetres and finally the seventh light at 7 centimetres. 
This is currently just a standard distance measurer with reminders at specific distances. 
However, the code can be slightly adjusted to turn this into a build used to enforce social distancing.

No calculations were required in this project. 220 ohm resistors were used for the LEDs.
